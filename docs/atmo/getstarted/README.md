# Get Started

Atmo is a self-hosted platform that uses a _Runnable bundle_ to run your described application. The bundle includes two things: a [Directive](../concepts/the-directive.md), and a set of [Runnables](../concepts/runnables.md) \(WebAssembly modules compiled from various languages such as TypeScript, Rust and Swift\). A bundle contains everything needed to run your application.

## Requirements

{% hint style="info" %}
**You'll need to install the subo CLI tool and Docker to use Atmo**.

To install the tool, [visit the subo repository](https://github.com/suborbital/subo).

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) is used to build Runnables and run the Atmo development server.
